# Minehut Dashboard
This project aims to rewrite the Minehut panel from scratch.

## Why?
Simply, the existing panel is a mess. It is extremely slow, which is not great
if you are running low-end hardware.

A few issues in particular:

* The canvas element on the homepage hurts performance on low-end computers and mobile
devices.
* The outrageous number of network requests sent.
